  The way we work today is fundamentally different than it was 20 years ago, and
  the last few years have provided opportunities for radical change. In both the
  public and private sectors, people are moving toward a combination of
  office-based and remote ways of working. GSA’s Center for Workplace Strategy
  works with clients to support their mission delivery – wherever it occurs – by
  integrating people, spaces, and technology.

Workplace 2030 is GSA’s effort to lead and support the federal government through the Return to Office and the Future of Work. Distributed work, shared space, and customized implementation are the foundation of the new Workplace 2030 services being developed and offered by GSA to federal agencies.

Workplace 2030 will propel federal work into the next decade with renewed commitment to:

- Government’s stewardship of the environment
- Representation and workplace equity
- The well-being of federal employees and their customers
- Economic growth
