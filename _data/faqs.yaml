- question: How can GSA facilitate federal coworking across the national portfolio?
  answer: >-
    GSA will prototype on-demand coworking spaces for federal employees and
    agencies to reserve in GSA-managed leases and buildings. These sites will
    be physically and technologically secure and will be available to federal
    agencies on an as-needed basis or through a more semi-permanent agreement.
    Since two-thirds of GSA's real estate inventory is general office space,
    we predict federal coworking will be a cost-saving, flexible space
    solution.
